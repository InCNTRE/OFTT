What is OFTT?
-------------

OFTT is a test harness that enables the performance of different tests against an Openflow switch. OFTT uses the OpenVswitch OpenFlow controller module, which has been modified for testing purposes. A python-based test language is used to define test cases when are executed against the device under test (DUT).

In OFTT, tests consist of adding and deleting different flow combinations within different time intervals. When used against the JUNOS OpenFlow implementation, information is also gathered from the operating system on the device under test (DUT) in respect to resource usage while the test cases are being executed.

NOTE - this test framework does not interact with a traffic-generation source. A traffic-generator should be used for generating the traffic streams against which the flow-matching will take place but the traffic-generator is controlled independently.

NOTE - Only one switch instance is supported per OFTT instance.

The package consists of the modified Open VSwitch controller together with a set of test-cases which can be executed against the DUT. The test-cases can be modified to suit the user's needs.

The OFTT package is executed on a Linux host platform that must have network access to the Openflow switch device under test.

Requirements
------------
Linux distribution including GCC and GNU Make including libc-devel (and Development Tools packages for your Linux distribution)

Python 2.4.3 or later

JUNOS SDK Openflow Application v1.0 or later

Openflow 1.0 compliant switch

Installation
------------

1. download the .gz file containing the OFTT files

Further steps of this instruction assume that you are in package top directory <OFTestTools>

2. 'cd ./ovsTtools'

3. 'make'. This will build the ovs-controller, ovs-ofctl module (part of Open VSwitch package) as well as the OFTT modules. 
	
	You should not see any compilation errors. 'ovs-controller' and 'ovs-ofctl' binaries should appear in OVS_tools directory (compilation tested with GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48) and GNU Make 3.81)
	
4. 'cd ..'

5. 'chmod 777 StartController ExecuteTest' (if needed)

6. Change the configuration file 'configuration.cfg' according to your needs 
   (see 'Configuration file structure' section for details)

7. Enable key-based ssh authentication for a configured user between the DUT and OFTT 
	(see 'Miscellaneous' section below)

NOTE: If you are using non-default (6633) port number for OpenFlow control channel communication between the DUT and OFTT, you must modify the 'StartController' file. 

OFTT Operation
--------------

1) './StartController' -> this will execute the script to start the OFTT controller. In the case where the DUT has already been configured to communicate with the controller, a connection will be established using the configured TCP port. The DUT can be configured at a later point and still successfully connect to the OFTT controller.

During the DUT connection to OFTT controller you should see something like this:

-bash-3.2$ ./StartController

Oct 14 07:09:19|00006|vconn|DBG|tcp:<SW_IP>:<port>: received: hello (xid=0xe4ff0):


2) './Executetest testCases/testCase' -> this step will execute the the test case 'testCase'. All test cases should be placed in the './testCases' directory (test cases tested using Python 2.4.3)

Configuration file structure ('configuration.cfg')
--------------------------------------------------

[Installation Dirs]
OVS_TOOLS_DIR: ovsTools                     	#Path to directory with OVS tools binaries 

[Switch]
SWITCH_IP: 10.1.1.1                          	#IP address / hostname of a switch to be tested
SWITCH_ID: 0									#The id of a switch configured on DUT
SWITCH_USER: lab                            	#Username configured on the DUT
SWITCH_TRACEFILE: ext/juniperipgcto/of_trace	#Location of TRACES on the DUT

[Resources Monitor]
RESOURCES_FILE_PREFIX: system_resources     	#Name of a file to which switch resources information is written during test
												#case execution. NOTE - This is a JUNOS-specific function.
SAMPLING_FREQUENCY: 3                       	#Switch resources sampling frequency. NOTE - This is a JUNOS-specific 
										    	#function.


JUNOS Resources Monitor
-----------------------
The resources monitor is a separate process, which collects information from the DUT during test execution. This is a JUNOS-specific function and does not apply to generic OpenFlow switches when configured as the DUT.

The resource monitor process is started automatically when the test case is executed. Currently information about following processes is gathered: dfwd, sampled, of-switchd. The number of programmed flow entries is also gathered. 
The results are written to file configured in RESOURCES_FILE_PREFIX option value in test tool configuration.


Miscellaneous
-------------
In order to enable key-based SSH authentication between OFTT and the DUT, one must generate the required keys on the OFTT host machine and copy the key onto the DUT. For JUNOS, follow the following steps:

1. Invoke 'ssh-keygen -t rsa' on OFTT host machine. Use default values for each option to be set. 
   This will generate a private and public keypair in '~/.ssh' directory (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub). 

2. Ensure that there is a user account created on the DUT where the username == the username contained in the configuration.cfg file. This can be done using the following 'set' commands in configuration mode:

	'set system login user <configured_user> class super-user'
	'commit'

3. Copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) to the DUT to '/var/home/<configured_user>/.ssh'. This can be acheived using a range of file-transfer options from the router including FTP and scp. 

3. Add the key to the user account by logging in to the DUT and in JUNOS configuration mode, issue the command:

   'set system login user <configured_user> authentication load-key-file <path_to_public_key>'
   'commit'
   
4. Check that ssh access is now working by trying to start an ssh session from the OFTT host machine to the DUT 
	(ssh <configured_user>@<DUT ip address or DNS name>). Access to the configured user account should be now enabled without entering the password.



Writing test cases
------------------
All test cases should be placed in './testCases' directory. Each individual test case should be placed in separate file. 
There is no fixed format for the test case filename. 

Each testcase is programmatically defined as a Python class named 'TestCase'. Each test case should instantiate the OFTestTool class object in its constructor. Each test case should implement a method called 'run' where the test case execution is programmed. The example below provides a basic test-case container:

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

import sys
import OFTestTool

sys.path.append('../')

class TestCase:

    """This is an example test case"""

        def __init__(self):
            self.myOFTestTool = OFTestTool.OFTestTool()

        def run(self):

        """Write your test code here. Use methods from OFTestTool class"""
        
             self.myOFTestTool.aMethodFromOFTestToolClass()
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


The following example is located in directory "testCases".

The following test case (Flows002.py) adds 10 flows that match:

incoming port 1, 
Ethernet frame type: 0x800, 
Input VLAN id: 0-9, 
Ethernet destination address: 00:33:44:22:11:11, 
IP protocol: 6 (TCP), 
Action : forward via port 2.

import sys, socket, struct
import OFTestTool

sys.path.append('../')

class TestCase:

    """This is FLOWS002 example test case defined in test template document -> add predefined flows to the application"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.myOFTestTool = OFTestTool.OFTestTool()

    def run(self):
        numberOfFlows = 10

        for n in range(numberOfFlows):

            flow = "in_port=1,dl_type=0x800,dl_vlan=" + str(n) + ",dl_dst=00:33:44:22:11:11,nw_proto=6,actions=output:2"
            self.myOFTestTool.addFlow(flow)

        print "You may now check whether the flows were added to OF app... \n" \
              "Invoke \"show openflow switch statistics flows <SW_ID>\" command in the switch console \n" \
              "Also automatic check is going to be processed "

        self.myOFTestTool.wait(5)

        if(self.myOFTestTool.getFlowsNumber() != numberOfFlows):
            print "Automatic check failed !!! - not all expected flows were added to OF app"
            return

        print "TEST OK :)"
